* Problem 1

In a batch reactor the concentration of A starts out at 1 M. Ten minutes later, the concentration is 0.6 M. Assuming the reaction occurs at a rate of $-r_A = k C_A$,  use math software to determine what $k$ must be. Make sure to show how you arrived at the equations you solved.

* Problem 2
The reaction $A \rightarrow B$ occurs in a batch reactor. $A$ is consumed at a rate of $-r_A = k C_A^{2}$ with $k=0.33$ L/mol/min. The initial concentration of A in the reactor is 2.5 M. Make a plot of the concentration of A as a function of time, and calculate the concentration of A after 10 minutes.
