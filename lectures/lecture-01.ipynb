Can we do it at an economical rate?\n2.  How big should a reactor be to make a product at some rate?\n3.  How much heat do we have add/remove to keep the reactor at a safe temperature?\n4.  Is it safe to operate a reactor under some conditions?\n\nThese are just some of the questions we have to answer, and we have to answer them **quantitatively**. \n\nTo do that we must develop mathematical equations that describe the rate of disappearance of reactants and the rate of production of products. Then we have to solve those equations. We will use mathematical software extensively to solve them.\n\n\n## Reactions convert reactants to products\n\nWe express a reaction like this\n\n $A + 2B \\rightarrow C + D$ \n\nThat means 1 mole of A reacts with two moles of B to produce one mole of C and one mole of D. Reactants are on the left side of the arrow, and products are on the right.\n\nThe numbers in front of the species are called stoichiometric coefficients. They do not have to be integers, e.g.  $H_2 + 1/2 O_2 \\rightarrow H_2O$ .\n\nReactions must be balanced, which means that there are the same number of elements on each side. That is required for conservation of mass.\n\n\n## Reaction rates\n\nThe rate of disappearance of A is denoted  $-r_A$ and it has units of mol/(volume \\* time).\n\nThe rate of production of C is denoted  $r_C$ .\n\nIf we have  $-r_A = 4 mol/(L\\cdot s)$ then we know that:\n\n $-r_B = 8 mol/(L\\cdot s)$ and  $r_C = 4 mol/(L\\cdot s)$ \n\nor\n\nmore generally for this reaction:  $-r_B = -2 r_A$ \n\n\n## The rate law is an algebraic function\n\n $-r_A$ will generally depend on the concentrations of all the species, and the temperature.\n\nIt will be an algebraic function. Here are some examples:\n\n $-r_A = k C_A$ \n\n $-r_A = k C_A^{3/2}$ \n\n $-r_A = k C_A^2$ \n\n $-r_A = k C_A C_B$ \n\n $-r_A = \\frac{k_1 C_A}{1 + k_2 C_A}$ \n\n $r_A$ will always have units like mol / (volume \\* time). The concentrations will always have units like mol / vol. The constants in the rate laws will have units appropriate to make these units work.\n\nThese will be given for a while.\n\n\n## The mole balance\n\nThe mole balance will be the foundation of reactor design.\n\n![img](./images/control-volume.png)\n\nIn - Out + Generation = Accumulation\n\n $F_{A0} - F_A + G_A = \\frac{dN_A}{dt}$ \n\n $F_{A0}$ is the molar flow of A in the volume (mol/time)\n\n $F_A$ is the molar flow of A out of the volume.\n\n $G_A = V \\cdot r_A$ and it is the rate that A is generated **inside** the volume.\n\n $\\frac{dN_A}{dt}$ is the rate of change of the number of moles in the volume.\n\nWe will spend several weeks looking at various forms and applications of this equation:\n\n1.  No flows (batch reactor)\n2.  Steady state, constant well-mixed, volume (CSTR)\n3.  Steady state, plug flow reactor\n\n\n# The batch reactor\n\nSuppose we have a reaction  $A \\rightarrow B$ , where it is known that  $-r_A = k C_A$ , and  $k=0.23 1/min$ . We start the reactor at  $t=0$ with a concentration of  $C_{A0} = 2 mol/L$ . The reactor has a volume of 2 L. What is the concentration of A after 5 minutes?\n\nIf there is no flow, the equation simplifies to:\n\n $\\frac{dN_A}{dt} = V \\cdot -k C_A$ .\n\nIF the volume is constant, we can simplify this to:\n\n $\\frac{dC_A}{dt} = -k C_A$ .\n\nWhich is a simple differential equation with the initial condition of  $C_A(t=0) = 2$ .\n\nThe solution is:\n\n $C_A(t) = C_{A0} exp(-k t)$ .\n\nLet's take a look at this function and plot how  $C_A$ changes with time. This is our first look at Python. \n\nSeveral new things to note.\n\n1.  We use \"magic\" with %matplotlib inline to get the figure to show inline.\n2.  We import the plotting and numpy libraries to get access to the functions. You only need to import these once, and often we do it first at the top of the notebook.\n3.  We create some variables to store values.\n4.  numpy creates arrays, and has array-based functions (i.e. array in, array out with element-wise operations)\n5.  We made an array of time values, and then evaluated the concentration expression for each value. Finally, we use some plot commands to make a figure.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":""}],"source":["%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nk = 0.23  # 1/s\nCa0 = 2  # mol / L\n\nt = np.linspace(0, 10)  # an array of 50 points from 0 to 10\nCa = Ca0 * np.exp(-k * t)  # an array of 50 values of Ca as a function of t\n\nplt.plot(t, Ca)\nplt.xlabel('t (min)')\nplt.ylabel('$C_A$ (M)')\nplt.show()\n# To execute this in the IPython notebook, select the cell, and type C-Ret."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["It is easy to get help on these commands.

First, the natural log function is np.log (there is another function np.log10 for the base 10 log).

Third, we used a format option 1.2f, which means format this argument as a float with two decimal places. We will ignore what the 1 means for now.

The algebra may be very tedious, which means there are lots of opportunities for mistakes.\n2.

This equation is nonlinear in  $t$ , so we need to use an iterative solver. The strategy is we define a function that will be equal to zero at the solution we want. For example to solve the equation:\n\n $0.5 = C_{A0} e^{- k t}$ for t, we need a function that is:\n\n $f(t) = 0 = 0.5 - C_{A0} e^{- k t}$ \n\nThen we can use a solver to find the value of  $t$ .

But, they can help us solve a lot of them.\n\n\n# Integrating differential equations\n\nThe final approach to this problem is to solve the differential equation numerically. We started with this mole balance:\n\n $\\frac{dC_A}{dt} = - k C_A$ \n\nwith  $C_A(t=0)=C_{A0}$ \n\nWe can use Python to integrate this. To this, we need to write the differential equation in the standard form:\n\n $y'(x) = f(x, y)$ \n\nHere we have:\n\n $y'(t) = -k C_A$ , which is already in standard form, so the function we need is  $f(t) = -k Ca$ \n\nThen, we need to integrate from the initial condition to some later time. We get the solution evaluated at the time points we specify.
